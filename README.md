Topic : The Unified Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score  

Language / Application: Python in Jupyter Notebook

Task : Find out the best MLR model to predict the UPDRS scores based on the dataset.

Objectives : To identify and predict the target variable based on a few sets of preditors/independent variables by the best MLR model in the dataset of UPDRS scores. The method that being applied to get the best models in MLR which is the forward selection by using cross-validation with the k of 10.
